# Welcome!

## `whoami`

Hi there! My name's Em (y'know, like the dash: `â€“`), and this is my little pocket of the Web. On GitHub, I'm known as [MicrocosEm](https://github.com/microcosem)!

## `pwd`

I am currently the **Manager of Product Documentation** **at [CoreWeave](https://coreweave.com)** and I absolutely adore it. (Recruiters, thank you so much for your interest, but I love where I work!)

## `history`

My start down the digital road was an unusual one: I cut my teeth on digital infrastructure by deploying services on Raspberry Pis for neighborhood use in New York City, with the end goal of creating services like a local OMEMO-encrypted XMPP chat for a neighborhood-wide intranet on [the NYC Mesh](https://www.nycmesh.net).

I've also done a lot of work on several **educational initiatives** centering with **digital security and privacy** outside of the industry sphere. I helped **found and run a small school**, and later co-organized a **grassroots conference** centered around fundamental digital skills, privacy, and security.

## `ps -ef`

A few years ago, I discovered, fell in love with, and pursued a career in **technical writing**.

I now manage an amazing team of technical writers and docs engineers and direct [product documentation at CoreWeave](https://docs.coreweave.com), the GPU cloud!
