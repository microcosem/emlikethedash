I'm Em, like the dash â€“ **Documentation Engineer** and current **Manager of Product Documentation at [CoreWeave](https://coreweave.com)**.

I build and scale technical documentation programs and digital infrastructure for high-growth infrastructure and open source projects. I bring expertise in **docs-as-code**, **ML/AI workflows and platforms**, and **Kubernetes** ecosystems, to create impactful documentation strategies and lead cross-functional teams collaboratively and empathetically.

More work is due to come here! In the meantime, visit me here:
