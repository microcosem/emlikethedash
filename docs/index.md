I'm Em – like the dash – Documentation Engineer and current **Manager of Product Documentation at [CoreWeave](https://coreweave.com)**, where I write about **HPC networking, ML/AI workloads,** and **Kubernetes.**

I'm currently revamping my little corner of the Web, and writing some new content!

In the meantime, [visit me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/em-h-2b80992b3/).
