# Welcome!

## `whoami`
Hi there! My name's Em (like the dash, `–`), and this is my little pocket of the Web. I'm also known as [MicrocosEm](https://github.com/microcosem) on GitHub!

## `pwd`
I am currenly a Managing Editor at [CoreWeave](https://coreweave.com) and I absolutely adore it.

(Recruiters - thank you so much for your interest, but I love where I work!)

## `history`
My roots are in the art world (especially photography - portfolio coming soon!), but in the tech world, I stem from being a **DevOps engineer** and a **Site Reliability Engineer**.

Nowadays, however, my heart belongs with **technical writing** and **documentation engineering** and now, with empowering my team of technical writers and docs engineers.

I've generally done a lot with digital infrastructure, especially hacky things for public benefit, like networking Raspberry Pis on an [existing citywide mesh network](https://www.nycmesh.net/_), co-founding a small school for the tech "they don't teach," or organizing a grassroots conference on digital privacy.

Professionally, I've worked mainly in startup environments. I prefer fast-paced, interesting places where people come up with creative and sometimes genius solutions to tough problems.

I built this site to hang my hat on something Internet. Here, you'll also find my résumé, some blog post [*musings*](./blog/index.md), and - chocolates? Maybe? You never know!
