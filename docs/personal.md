## Selections

For the last few years, I have been shepherding, directing, editing, and contributing to all of [CoreWeave's product documentation at docs.coreweave.com](https://docs.coreweave.com).

**Today, most of my authoring effort is spent collaborating with my team on everything there.**

Here are a few additional things I've written that I really like:
