-   :material-pencil:{ .lg .middle } **How to Become a Technical Writer (`awesome-technical-writing`)**

    ---
    A wiki I've started on [my fork](https://github.com/microcosem/awesome-technical-writing) of the awesome-technical-writing [awesome list](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list). Leveraging community contributed resources in the awesome list, I'm writing the wiki to serve as a primer for those looking to get into the career of technical writing for software and digital infrastructure today.
