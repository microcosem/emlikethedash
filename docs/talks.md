## Topics I think are neat

Here are some topics I plan to talk about (and of course probably write about) in the near future. Watch this space!

### "Tech Writers as DevRel"

Building a DevRel team that empowers technical writers to become SMEs in their own right is an exciting concept - but tech writers who fear that this progression pushes them too far into marketing don't have baseless concerns. What does it look like to have a successful DevRel team that involves technical writers from the ground up?

### "Diátaxis vs. DITA: How did we get here?"

[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) is quickly emerging as the new standard for documentation, but many decry it as simply the same thing as the much older, much more established [Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture). So why is Diátaxis winning, and what's the difference, anyway?

### "Docs-as-Code: A History for a Future"

As the rift between modern and traditional documentation skills and practices widens, one thing that poses a difficulty for technical writers is the misunderstanding of what docs-as-code (DaC) actually means, as the term has become divorced from its relationship to its founding principal, infrastructure-as-code (IaC). In order to ensure technical writers are best equipped for a quickly shifting landscape, we must clarify what this terminology actually means, and - more importantly - come to grips with why it matters.

### "'Why don't you make GPT-4 write it?': How ML/AI and Tech Writing Can Be Happy Together"

Okay admittedly this one has a super long title. Like, maybe too long. Maybe GPT-4 can help me make a more succinct title.

There's no arguing it: machine learning and AI are changing the way every industry under the sun functions. We are at the precipice of a new industrial revolution. So what does that mean for writers? Is gen AI text the new Gutenberg? Should we all fear for our jobs (and what does that mean about the nature of our jobs, if so)? I'm here to tell you that AI and technical writing don't have to be at war - in fact, much as programming has already seen, the two can be very happy together.
