## "Invisible" docs are good docs

Documentation and design share a few key characteristics, but none is so poignant to me as the principle, "design is successful when it is invisible." The premise here is that if the goal of design is to enable in such a truly seamless way that the person does not even _notice_ they are being enabled.

Although we are reinforced to reach for the thing that is _easiest to use_, it is rare that anyone who isn't a designer notices _how_ that ease was achieved, because there is no friction. Conversely, design fails when it gets so immediately in the way that the design is _all that is seen_ by virtue of its failings.

Indeed, technical documentation shares this quality: frictionless, seamless experiences are what we all want, in most cases - we want to be able to realize our goal without struggling to achieve it.

Documentation achieves this level of "good invisibility" a few different ways, but the one I want to focus on now is **whether or not the documentation is always up-to-date.** A simple enough principle, but without sufficient automations and pipelines in place, this goal is seldom achieved - but, in the era of AI, it seems inconceivable not to have such pipelines in place.

**So how do we do it?** Enter MCP.

## From reactive to proactive

The breakthrough of DevOps was to abandon waterfall-style development at scale and more to a much more dynamic, adaptive framework. We are seeing another such pivot today. Traditionally, documentation has followed a **reactive** development model: developers build features, then communicate the change either directly or through a pipeline of other people. Documentation gets updated, hopefully, but then slowly drifts out of sync with reality due to the constraints of the loop.

By the time someone notices the disconnect, though, developers have already moved on to other solutions. The docs are no longer invisible.

## Model context protocol (MCP) for proactive documentation

What if your docs site could update itself, in a process augmented by human oversight? [Model context protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) makes this dream a reality.

### Docs as client/server

The gist of MCP is this: there are [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts), which are really just small programs, and [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts), which are also little programs.

Leveraging MCP for documentation involves deploying sites as (or, running) MCP clients, which continuously query MCP servers that host critical product information.

MCP empowers documentation to be self-updating though:

- **Continuous monitoring**: Documentation sites either run scheduled jobs to query MCP servers for information like API schemas, configuration options, feature flags, or system states, or are triggered to run when a change is detected, depending on how the architecture is configured. These jobs compare the current product state against the documented content, and are then able to detect discrepancies, such as new endpoints, changed parameters, or deprecated features.

- **Intelligent change detection**: Rather than generating noisy bulk updates, the system can be configured to create focused pull requests targeting specific APIs or components.

- **Contextual updates**: Each PR includes rich context about why changes occurred, sourced from commit messages or changelogs, and may include things like pre-populated validation results that can be run autonomously, and [confidence scores](#confidence-scoring).

### Smart automation and good practice

#### Confidence scoring

Every automated change can include reliability indicators that help reviewers and stakeholders understand the quality of each suggestion. An example scale of confidence scores may be something like:

- **High confidence (90-100%)**: Straightforward additions like new API endpoints with complete specs
- **Medium confidence (60-89%)**: Parameter type changes or URL modifications that need validation
- **Low confidence (30-59%)**: Complex changes requiring additional reviewer attention
- **Very low confidence (<30%)**: Conflicting information that converts to human investigation issues

Confidence scoring changes the review paradigm - when accurate, they can greatly reduce the amount of time required for a given review, and even direct SME reviewers to specific changes where additional verification is needed.

#### Circuit breakers

"Circuit breakers" in this system prevent PR spam during major refactors by detecting unusual change patterns. For example, when PR activity exceeds normal thresholds, it creates summary issues instead of individual PRs, then resumes automation after activity normalizes. Ci

#### Conflict resolution

Smart detection identifies when automated changes conflict with recent human edits, then flag these for manual review, rather than creating problematic PRs.

### Enhanced review experience

Given the proper setup, during PR reviews, SMEs can invoke MCP-powered tools through GitHub bot commands. For example:

- `/check-accuracy` triggers real-time validation against current APIs
- `/related-docs` surfaces documentation requiring similar updates, if not already included in the PR  
- `/context [component]` retrieves current system state information

## Vision for global MCP adoption

The ideal MCP documentation ecosystem has the power to transform how developers learn and implement the protocol worldwide.

### Living documentation as protocol authority

By operating documentation sites as MCP clients that continuously validate examples, specifications, and integration patterns against live MCP servers, we create self-healing documentation, where:

- Code examples are automatically tested (i.e. "docs-as-tests" practices), alleviating work for the writer or QA engineer (critically, the tests are run against _live implementations_ of complex systems, not just static models)
- Deprecated patterns are flagged in real-time
- Security compliance is verified continuously

### How do we teach more people about MCP magic?

I'm a strong believer in "learn by doing." It's one of the reasons I made [starlight-mcp](https://github.com/microcosem/starlight-with-mcp), a very barebones, basic example with working tests to demonstrate how a mock API running its own MCP server could help a docs site running an MCP client could ingest changes to the API schema, and then automatically publish them. (Plus I'm learning more about Starlight, so this seemed like a fun way to incorporate both.)

!!!info "A note on starting with APIs"
    Although I do think that API docs are one of the best places to start, I also think API docs as a first encounter with MCP run the risk of being slightly less impressive to those who already have really solid CI/CD pipelines for autogenerated API docs. Going from programmatic to MCP is a little bit less fireworks-y than leveraging MCP to ingest really complex, non-standardized data. But, again, the API demo is a really easy place to start.

We are already in a world where a plethora of [MCP servers](https://github.com/awesome-mcp-clients) and [clients](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers) are already popping up all over the place, but I'd love to see more readily-accessible, open source demos for beginners that can be pulled down from a repo and walk the user through the process.

## Welcome to the future of invisible

MCP-powered approaches to documentation development transform documentation development from bottlenecked, static waterfalls to dynamic, self-healing, three-dimensional ecosystems. By creating self-maintaining documentation ecosystems where accuracy improves continuously through automated monitoring, intelligent change detection, and enhanced human review processes, we enable documentation that scales.

With self-healing, self-updating documentation, the developer experience gets that much closer to being frictionlessly "invisible."
