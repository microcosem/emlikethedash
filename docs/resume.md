**Managing Editor • Documentation Engineer • Technical Writer**

I am relentlessly in pursuit of quality, achieved collaboratively. I do my best to empower the people I work with to feel satisfied in what they do, to enable them to grow and learn, and to be adequately challenged at the same time as sufficiently supported. I am a voracious learner, and a big fan of unconventional approaches.

## Experience

### **Managing Editor** at **CoreWeave, Inc.** – New York (Remote)

*June 2022 - Present*

Initially hired as the sole technical writer for what is now one of the most high-profile startups in the world, creating documentation for a specialized Cloud provider serving  high-end GPUs and cutting-edge infrastructure for ML/AI and VFX clients.

With no existing documentation structure or processes, I took charge of updating all existing content in public-facing documentation, creating a new documentation development lifecycle with project management, while simultaneously generating new content as products developed and evolved.

I aided in onboarding the second hire, moving into implementing the DITA framework, Diátaxis, for our documentation. I created the role of Managing Editor, and successfully pitched myself as a fit for the role with the support of my peers.

Today, I support my team members and cross-functional stakeholders in accomplishing tasks and iteratively improving on all things related to our internal and external documentation.

### **Technical Writer** at **Bolt, Inc.** – New York (Remote)

*June 2021 - October 2022*

Hired as the second ever team member, I helped develop the documentation processes at a fast-paced fintech company.

Using Hugo hosted on Netlify in concert with Swagger CLI, I documented APIs, platform user flows, UX and UI elements, as well as internal documentation ranging from general procedure to data privacy for clients and end users.

I also helped organize the internal queer affiliate group, organizing happy hours focusing on the queer-identifying members of the company while keeping it open to all.

Independent initiatives included developing automated systems for docs-as-code workflows, introducing a systematized pipeline in support of processes that resulted in improved cross-collaboration between Customer Education and all other teams (Engineering, Product, and Marketing).

Collaborated with educational designers and other key stakeholders to develop and implement  effective information architecture strategies in coordination with client-oriented educational design materials.

### **Site Reliability Engineer** at **Fairwinds, Inc.** – Boston (Remote)

*December 2019 - June 2021*

Built, managed, and improved on Kubernetes clusters in staging and production environments for clients around the world.

Conferred face-to-face with clients in order to understand their infrastructure needs, then helped design and implement the appropriate configurations across EKS, AWS (with kOps), GKE, and AKS providers.
Served as Security Officer, researching current security bulletins related to infrastructure and Kubernetes; developed internal and client-facing communications on discovered vulnerabilities.
Contributed code for internally developed Terraform modules and other tooling written in Python and Bash.
Guided the design of team processes and structure for developing scalable, repeatable, dependable operations across the engineering department. Headed internal learning and development programs. Selected to act as a bridge between engineers and leadership. Was selected to organize and lead most weekly engineering meetings.

During my time as a consultant, I took on the role of internal technical writer, taking ownership of the internal knowledgebase and technical wiki. I instigated the adoption of an internal RFC process for making department-wide decisions and proposals for advancing our technical standards.

### **DevOps Engineer** at **Fractured Atlas** – New York (Remote)

*2018 - 2019*

Acted as primary support for team leadership. Performed research and testing, aided in containerizing applications, and orchestrated containers using Docker Compose and later Kubernetes.
Manually administered Linux infrastructure across CentOS and Ubuntu environments. Researched and implemented solutions for product software. Researched and learned about Solr clusters for search capabilities.

Managed operations-critical software, such as LDAP and Windows machines running financial software.Facilitated the onboarding of macOS management Jamf Pro across the organization, acting as a technical connection point between Jamf representatives and internal management.

## Personal projects

### Stealthcloud

### I/O

*2017-2020*

As an off-shoot of the Tech Learning Collective, I/O was a neighborhood tech co-working space and open hack lab hosted in the beautiful old venue of The Footlight music hall in Ridgewood, Queens. Each week opened our doors for anyone to bring their projects, ideas, give a talk or demo, and so on - all while enjoying the local musical residency in the other part of the space.

### Hacker Brunch

*2017*

Using the unclaimed produce from a local farm CSA, I co-organized a weekly event, where free brunch foods were cooked and served to all participants in attendance. Students used CTF hacking games to learn cybersecurity fundemtnals, with instruction from knowledgeable leaders.

### Flora Posidonia & The Healer's Flea

*2018*

I produced my own fully functional Web store for selling products such as teas and tinctures at in-person fleas. I leveraged the same organizing infrastructure to organize a "flea market" full of local creators, crafters, 

### The Neighborhood Digital Library Project

*2017-2020*

Inspired by the [Equitable Internet Initiative of the Detroit Community Technology Project](https://detroitcommunitytech.org/eii), I worked with network engineers and other sysadmins in the hopes of leveraging [the NYC Mesh project](https://www.nycmesh.net/) to connect several Raspberry Pis hosted locally in different small businesses throughout the New York neighborhood of Ridgewood, Queens, with the goal of serving free, DRM-free books on a neighborhood-wide intranet. The curiosity was driven by wanting to provide valuable resources by focusing on the intranet inherent in building Internet infrastructure.

Co-founded an independent school, providing high-quality technical education with a focus on accessibility for underrepresented identities in tech.
