I pursue quality achieved collaboratively. I strive to empower the people I work with to do their best work, to grow, and to feel satisfied in their work. I am a voracious learner, and a big fan of unconventional approaches to problem solving.

### **CoreWeave, Inc.** – Manager of Product Documentation

January 2024 - Present

As **Manager** of Product Documentation at CoreWeave, I manage a team of amazing writer-engineers to produce extremely high quality, customer-facing documentation on all of CoreWeave's **cloud services and products**. We leverage **the Diátaxis framework** alongside crafting learning paths to educate our incredible customers on some of the most cutting-edge technology there is, and world-firsts developed by our own colleagues.

As CoreWeave is a **GPU cloud provider**, we write about everything from Kubernetes, to **Slurm** on Kubernetes (SUNK), to Object Storage, to RDMA over InfiniBand, to **model training and inference**, and beyond.

    Helped represent CoreWeave at [the Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) in Philadelphia (2024), and at an event hosted by the [British Consulate in Philadelphia](https://www.british-consulate.net/uk/United-Kingdom-Consular-Assistance-Philadelphia).

### **CoreWeave, Inc.** – Senior Technical Writer

2022 - 2024

As the sole technical writer at the time, I took on the task of editing and re-structuring all existing public-facing documentation, simultaneously generating new articles while implementing the first formal lifecycle processes for all product documentation. I wore the hat of project manager, product manager, and technical writer, all rolled into one.

### **Bolt, Inc.** – Technical Writer

2021 - 2022

Hired as the second ever technical writer for the organization, I helped evolve documentation lifecycle processes. We wrote docs on **Hugo** hosted on **Netlify** in concert with **Swagger CLI** for documenting **SaaS APIs**, platform user flows, and product UX and UI. Additionally, I authored **internal documentation** on data privacy and general SOPs.

I also developed automated systems for docs-as-code workflows, introducing a systematized pipeline in support of processes that improved cross-collaboration between the Customer Education team, Engineering, Product, and Marketing.

    I was selected for the board of the internal LGBTQIA+ employee resource group. I organized social hours to provide a safe and inclusive space for all LGBTQIA+ identifying members of the company and our coworker allies.

### **Fairwinds** – Site Reliability Engineer

December 2019 - June 2021

As a **Site Reliability Engineer** and **Kubernetes consultant** at Fairwinds, I worked with customers to understand their workload orchestration and cluster infrastructure needs, then aided in the design, implementation, improvement, and maintenance of appropriate setups across **EKS, AWS (using kOps), GKE, and AKS providers**.

I took initiative to develop team processes and organization structures for repeatable, scalable, dependable operations across the engineering department. I headed up **internal enablement and employee development programs**, and eventually led the engineering all hands meeting. I took ownership of **internal documentation, the internal knowledge base, and internal wiki**, and instigated the adoption of an internal **RFC process** for making department-wide decisions and proposals to create a better sense of visibility and ownership for evolutions in company process and policy.

!!!tip "And..."

    I served as **Security Officer**, researching current security bulletins related to cloud service providers and Kubernetes, in order to develop internal and client-facing communication on vulnerabilities. I also contributed to internal tools such as **Terraform** modules and other tooling written in **Python and Bash**.

### **Fractured Atlas** – DevOps Engineer

2018 - 2019

As the first hire for a growing DevOps team at a company focused on **non-profit software**, I acted as primary support for the team lead. I performed research and testing, aided in containerizing applications in **Docker**, then orchestrated containerized applications using **Docker Compose** and, later, **Kubernetes**.

I also took on sysadmin responsibilities, manually administering legacy **Linux** infrastructure (**CentOS** and **Ubuntu**). I worked with things like **Ruby**, **Solr**, and **Laravel PHP.** I also helped manage **LDAP**, facilitated the onboarding of macOS management **Jamf Pro**.

## Independent work

### Hacker Brunch

2017 - 2018

Using the unclaimed produce from a local farm CSA, I co-organized a weekly event where free brunch foods were communally prepared and enjoyed by all in attendance: folks from all over coming to play some CTF hacking games for the purpose of learning cybersecurity fundamentals hands on, with guidance from knowledgeable instructors.

### The Neighborhood Digital Library Project

2017-2020

Inspired by the [Equitable Internet Initiative of the Detroit Community Technology Project](https://detroitcommunitytech.org/eii), I worked with network engineers and other sysadmins in the hopes of leveraging [the NYC Mesh project](https://www.nycmesh.net/) to connect several Raspberry Pis hosted locally in different small businesses throughout the New York neighborhood of Ridgewood, Queens, with the goal of serving free, DRM-free books on a neighborhood-wide intranet. The curiosity was driven by wanting to provide valuable resources by focusing on the intranet inherent in building Internet infrastructure.

### Tech Learning Collective

Co-Founder & Lead Community Organizer

2017 - 2021

Co-founded an independent school, providing high-quality technical education with a focus on accessibility for underrepresented identities in tech.

### I/O

2017 - 2020

As an off-shoot of the Tech Learning Collective, I/O was a neighborhood tech co-working space and open hack lab hosted in the beautiful venue at The Footlight music hall in Ridgewood, Queens. Each week, we opened our doors for anyone to bring their projects, ideas, to give a talk or demo, whatever - all while enjoying a local musical residency in the other part of the space.

### Hackers Next Door

2019

Co-organized the Hackers Next Door conference, a two-day conference featuring speakers from organizations representing digital freedom, such as the Tor Project, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Black Movement-Law Project, the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, Calyx Institute, and many more.

Independently designed and implemented virtual structures in which students and alumni could connect and continue their independent projects.
