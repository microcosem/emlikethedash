### **CoreWeave, Inc.** – Manager of Product Documentation

January 2024 - Present

As **Manager of Product Documentation** at CoreWeave, I lead a team of amazing writer-engineers to produce high quality customer-facing documentation for all of CoreWeave's **cloud services and products**. We use **Docusaurus** to author documentation using MDX and Markdown, and publish using **Cloudflare**. Alongside docs organized using the **the Diátaxis framework**, we craft learning paths to educate our customers on some of the most cutting-edge technology there is, including world firsts developed by very our own colleagues.

CoreWeave is the **GPU cloud provider**. We write about everything from Kubernetes, to **Slurm** on Kubernetes (SUNK), to Object Storage, to RDMA over InfiniBand, to **model training and inference**, and beyond.

I wear the hat of **project manager**, **product manager**, **people manager**, and **technical writer**, all rolled into one.

    Helped represent CoreWeave at [the Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) in Philadelphia (2024), and at a related event hosted by the [British Consulate in Philadelphia](https://www.british-consulate.net/uk/United-Kingdom-Consular-Assistance-Philadelphia).

### **CoreWeave, Inc.** – Senior Technical Writer

2022 - 2024

As the first technical writer at the organization, I took charge of editing and re-structuring all existing public-facing documentation, as well as writing new content, while designing and implementing the first formal lifecycle processes for all product documentation.

### **Bolt, Inc.** – Technical Writer

2021 - 2022

As the second ever technical writer at Bolt, I helped evolve the **documentation lifecycle process**. We authored docs using **Hugo**, hosted on **Netlify**, in concert with **Swagger CLI** for **SaaS APIs**. I documented platform user flows and product UX and UI, and authored **internal documentation** covering **data privacy** as well as general SOPs.

I also developed automated systems for **docs-as-code workflows**, introducing a systematized pipeline in support of processes that improved cross-collaboration between the Customer Education team, Engineering, Product, and Marketing.

!!! tip "And..." 
    I was selected for the board of the internal LGBTQIA+ employee resource group. I organized social hours to provide a safe and inclusive space for all LGBTQIA+ identifying members of the company and our coworker allies.

### **Fairwinds** – Site Reliability Engineer

December 2019 - June 2021

As a **Site Reliability Engineer** and **Kubernetes consultant** at Fairwinds, I worked with customers to design Kubernetes clusters specific to the customer's workload orchestration and cluster infrastructure needs. I aided in all phases of the cluster lifecycle, from implementation, to upgrades, to general maintenance, using **EKS, AWS (using kOps), GKE, and AKS providers**. I used a lot of **Terraform**.

I took initiative on developing team processes and organization structures for repeatable, scalable, dependable operations across the engineering department, headed up **internal enablement and employee development programs**, and eventually led the engineering all hands meeting.

I took ownership of **internal documentation, the internal knowledge base, and internal wiki**, and instigated the adoption of an internal **RFC process** for making department-wide decisions and proposals to create a better sense of visibility and ownership for evolutions in company process and policy.

!!!tip "And..."

    I served as **Security Officer**, researching current security bulletins related to cloud service providers and Kubernetes, in order to develop internal and client-facing communication on vulnerabilities (CVEs). I also contributed to internal tools such as **Terraform** modules and other tooling written in **Python and Bash**.

### **Fractured Atlas** – DevOps Engineer

2018 - 2019

As the first hire for a growing DevOps team at a company focused on **non-profit software**, I acted as the primary support for the team lead. I performed research and testing on myriad tools, helping to containerize applications in **Docker**, then orchestrated containers using **Docker Compose** and, later, **Kubernetes**.

I also took on general sysadmin responsibilities, manually administering legacy **Linux** infrastructure (**CentOS** and **Ubuntu**). I worked with things like **Ruby**, **Solr**, and **Laravel PHP.** I also helped manage **LDAP** and facilitated the onboarding of macOS management **Jamf Pro**.

## Independent work

### Hacker Brunch

2017 - 2018

Using the unclaimed produce from a local farm CSA, I co-organized a weekly event where free brunch was communally prepared and enjoyed by folks from all over who came to play some CTF hacking games for the purpose of learning cybersecurity fundamentals hands-on, with guidance from knowledgeable instructors.

### The Neighborhood Digital Library Project

2017-2020

Inspired by the [Equitable Internet Initiative of the Detroit Community Technology Project](https://detroitcommunitytech.org/eii), I worked with network and infrastructure engineers on our own independent initiative leveraging [the NYC Mesh project](https://www.nycmesh.net) to connect several **Raspberry Pis** hosted locally in different small businesses throughout Queens, New York with the goal of serving resources on a **neighborhood-wide intranet**.

As an off-shoot of the Tech Learning Collective, I/O was a neighborhood tech co-working space and open hack lab hosted in the beautiful venue at The Footlight music hall in Ridgewood, Queens. Each week, we opened our doors for anyone to bring their projects, ideas, to give a talk or demo, whatever - all while enjoying a local musician residency in the other part of the space.

Co-organized the Hackers Next Door conference, a two-day conference featuring speakers from organizations representing digital freedom, such as the Tor Project, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Black Movement-Law Project, the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, Calyx Institute, and many more.
