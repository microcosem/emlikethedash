## âœ¨ Welcome to my digital corner

Hello and welcome! This repository holds the source for [my personal-professional website](https://emlikethedash.pages.dev).

## About the site

The site is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) with [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), and is built and hosted for the public by [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Building locally

To build the site locally for yourself, you may either [spin up a Docker container](#locally-with-docker) or [run a local development server](#local-development) directly.
